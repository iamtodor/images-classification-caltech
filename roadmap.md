# Roadmap

* Download dataset
* Investigate dataset
* Preprocess images
* Split dataset on train/validation parts
* Train simple classificator and evaluate it
* Know what neural networks means
* Create small NN and train it
* Compare results with simple classificator
* Study some optimization techniques - dropout, batchnorm, etc
* Explore varios data augmentation methods
* Build deep NN
* Is it works better?
* What about size/speed?
* Choose one of the size reduction method and implement it:
  * pruning, quantization
  * knowledge distillation
  * XNOR-net
  * you own method? 	
* Compare with all other teams
